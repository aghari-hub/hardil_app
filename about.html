  <h2>❤️ Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    HarDil begins with a simple belief — we are all family.
    Just like two people meet, shake hands, and hug each other,
    this app represents trust, unity, and responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    In HarDil, users are not customers.
    We are all part of one digital family.

  <h2>🎯 Motive & Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Today, mobile devices are overloaded with applications that consume
    storage, distract users, and make simple tasks complicated.
  </p>
  <p>
    HarDil solves this by organizing essential services section-wise
    and redirecting users only to official websites.
    This reduces storage usage and keeps digital life simple.

  <h2>🇮🇳 Built for Indian Users</h2>
  <p>

    with commonly used and trusted services presented
    in a clean, user-friendly manner.
