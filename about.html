      <strong>HarDil</strong> is a family-inspired digital platform created to bring
      commonly used and trusted services together in one place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The name <strong>HarDil</strong> is derived from two names — <strong>Hari</strong> and
      <strong>Dileep</strong>. It also aligns with the meaningful word
      <em>Hardil / Hardial</em>, which represents courage, unity, and divine favor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just like a family where people may have different thoughts and preferences
      yet stay together, HarDil brings different applications together under one
      platform while respecting individuality and choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      HarDil does not create, clone, embed, or modify any third-party applications.
      It simply redirects users to official websites, allowing them to log in and
      use services securely through their own browser.
