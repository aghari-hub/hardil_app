      The main motive of HarDil is to reduce the burden on user devices by avoiding
      unnecessary app installations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of downloading many applications, users can simply visit HarDil,
      choose the service they need, and get redirected to the official website.
    </p>

    <p>
      HarDil does not track users, does not store login credentials, 
      and does notcollect personal information. 
      Users are encouraged to use their default browser so login details
      remain safely stored on their own device.
    </p>

    <p>
      This platform is designed for family usage and awareness. We intentionally
      avoid addictive, harmful, or risky services such as betting and digital
      payment platforms to ensure safety and peace of mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Family comes first.</strong> HarDil encourages mindful usage of
      digital platforms and responsible online behavior.
